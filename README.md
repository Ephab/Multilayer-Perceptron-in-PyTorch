# Multilayer-Perceptron-in-PyTorch
A simple implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch.
This project is a continuation of my previous work where I built an MLP from scratch with NumPy, but here I leverage PyTorch for cleaner code, GPU acceleration, and more flexibility.


ðŸ“š Learning Goal 
-----

This repo serves as a learning project to:
- Transition from NumPy-only neural networks to PyTorch.
- Practice writing clean, modular deep learning code.
- Prepare for more advanced architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
